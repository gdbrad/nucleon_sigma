light quark mass dependence of hardron masses det. by XPT 
analytic terms depended on lECS of the chiral Lagrangian

lattice quark masses may be too large for su3 xpt to be valid, 
perturbative xpt behavior occurs only for mq < ms
WHY SU3 FLAVOR SYMMETRY EVIDENT IN BARYON PHENOMENOLOGY

1/n_c expansion constrains strucutre of baryon xpt 
chiral corrections to the chiral lagrangian ?? have to respect spin-flavor structure of 1/nc expansion 

mass relations(function of mq)  project baryon masses onto diff spin-flavor channels 


sometimes perturbative qcd is called asymptotic freedom 

operator expansion for mass splittings of octet and decuplet uses quark operators as operator basis, can also use skyrme operator basis. what is diff??


can use lo xpt to relate quark masses to pion masses  

in isospin limit of su3, only 2 ind. quark masses, 3 ind. meson masses.
one can always convert from a quark mass expansion to a meson mass expansion via the gell-mann-okubo relation
