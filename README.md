Project for determing the pion-nucleon sigma term by fitting $`\chi`$PT mass formula and extrapolating to the physical point. An analysis of the $\Delta^{++}$ baryon is also necessary since the finite volume corrections to the nucleon mass require delta input. 

Additionally, the constant $F_{\pi}$ and the pion mass require simultaneous analyses since they arise in the derivative expansion of the nucleon mass in our heavy baryon $`\chi`$PT formulation, which is amenable to numerical simulation -> extrapolation to the physical point.
