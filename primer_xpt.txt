flavor su(3) realized as global symm of hadron spectrum 

8 parameter, cpt, simply conn lie group 

h_abc is invariant under cyclic permutations i.e. h_abc = h_bca = h_cab

gauge principle generates interactions b/w matter fields through exchance of massless gauge bosons 

lagrangian containing only light flavor quarks in chiral limit, where mu, md, ms -> 0, starting pt. for low-energy QCD. 

global symms in ^ manifest in chirality matrix gamma_5

a chiral (field) var is one under which parity is tranformed into neither orig. var nor its neg. 

trans: x-> -x if x is a vector
